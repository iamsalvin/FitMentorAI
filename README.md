FitMentor – AI-Powered Fitness & Diet Assistant

Problem Statement / Objective:
Many people face difficulties in designing fitness routines and meal plans that are tailored to their individual goals, physical limitations, or health conditions. Traditional fitness coaching and diet planning are often expensive, generic, and non-interactive. There's a need for an accessible, intelligent system that can personalize workouts and diets in real-time using user preferences and health data.

Objective:
To create an AI-powered web application that delivers personalized fitness routines and dietary plans through an interactive voice and chat-based experience, improving accessibility to health and wellness guidance for everyone.

Proposed Solution:
FitMentor is an AI-integrated fitness assistant platform that combines conversational AI, real-time data handling, and personalized program generation. It allows users to:
• Interact with a Voice AI Assistant (Vapi) that understands fitness goals, physical limitations, and preferences.
• Leverage Gemini AI to generate real-time, personalized fitness plans and diet recommendations.
• Authenticate securely with Clerk (OAuth with Google, GitHub, or email/password).
• Manage fitness programs, allowing only the latest one to be active.
• Access a responsive UI that works across mobile, tablet, and desktop.
• Use Client & Server Components effectively via Next.js and React for scalable design.

Expected Output / Demonstrable Features
• Voice interaction with a conversational AI (Vapi)
• Personalized fitness workout plan generation (using Gemini AI)
• Personalized meal planning with dietary restrictions considered
• User sign-up/login using Clerk with OAuth support
• Program dashboard for creating and managing fitness plans
• Mobile-friendly, responsive user interface
• Real-time data synchronization with Convex DB

Example Use Cases:
• A user with a knee injury receives a customized low-impact fitness plan
• A vegan user receives a diet plan that excludes animal products
• A beginner receives a structured plan for getting started with fitness
